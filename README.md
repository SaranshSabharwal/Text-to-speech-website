# Text-to-speech-website
This interactive text-to-speech converter lets you type anything and hear it spoken aloud!  Built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses your browser's built-in speech capabilities to bring your text to life. Enter your message, press the button, and listen!

This project builds a text-to-speech converter using the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter text into a designated area and have it spoken aloud by the browser's built-in speech synthesis engine.

The user interface will be clean and intuitive, featuring a spacious text area for input and a prominent button to initiate the speech conversion.

Behind the scenes, JavaScript will leverage the Web Speech API to interact with the browser's speech capabilities.  When the button is clicked, the entered text is retrieved, and a SpeechSynthesisUtterance object is created. This object encapsulates the text to be spoken and allows for additional customizations like voice selection and speaking rate. Finally, the speak() method of the speechSynthesis object is called, bringing the text to life through synthesized speech.

This project offers several benefits:

Accessibility: It assists users with visual impairments or reading difficulties by converting written content into spoken audio.
Convenience: It allows users to have text read aloud while performing other tasks, maximizing multitasking potential.
Customization: The potential to incorporate features like voice selection and playback controls can enhance the user experience.
By combining HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, this project demonstrates the power of web development in creating user-friendly and interactive applications.
